# Student Management System

This project is a Student Management System built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It provides functionalities to manage student records, including adding, listing, updating, and deleting students.

## Frontend Setup

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the application.

3. The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations on student records.

## Features

- **List Students**: View all registered students in a list format.
- **Update Student**: Modify the details of an existing student.
- **Delete Student**: Remove a student from the records.

## Technologies Used
